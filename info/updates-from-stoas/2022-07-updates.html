        <h2>Updates from Stoics Around the World</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Each quarter, Stoic leaders from around the world share updates from their local Stoicism communities.
        </p>

        <h3><u>July 2022</u></h3>

<div style="text-align: left;">    

  <h3>Bellingham Stoics</h3>
  <p>This quarter we read Courage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus’ Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior. We also started reading Lives of the Stoics by Ryan Holiday. Both books were fascinating and were the basis for excellent conversations.</p>
  
  <h3>Estoicismo Mx</h3>
  <p>We've been reading Book VII of Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers by Diogenes Laertius, which is the one dedicated to Stoicism. All our activities are online and in spanish. If you'd like to join, please register: <a href="https://forms.gle/SH9m6qsF1rQ3L5Ht7">https://forms.gle/SH9m6qsF1rQ3L5Ht7</a></p>
  
  <h3>Estoicismo Practico (Stoicism Mexico)</h3>
  <p>Currently working on a new structure of hybrid meetings, and making a new plan of interaction with civil associations to take Stoicism to a young and vulnerable sector of society. </p>
  
  <h3>Frankfurt Stoics</h3>
  <p>We meet the 2nd Tuesday of every month either in a café or we go for a walk where we discuss philosophical topics. It is an open round with some regulars and also new participants via Meetup.</p>
  
  <h3>Hannover Stoics</h3>
  <p>Due to personal reasons, we're currently pausing our regular events; however, we will be facilitating the Stoicon-X 2022 on September 10th. This year´s speaker will be the philosophical practitioner Harry Wolf from Zurich, Switzerland, who is going to present key Stoic ideas by giving a short lecture, and through one or two exercises. Additional activities will complement this in-person-event. Tickets can be purchased on Eventbrite, where you will also find further details: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.de/e/stoa-antike-philosophie-moderne-lebenskunststoicon-x-hannover-2022-tickets-341253728087">https://www.eventbrite.de/e/stoa-antike-philosophie-moderne-lebenskunststoicon-x-hannover-2022-tickets-341253728087</a>
  Local residents who are interested in regular meetings or other events are encouraged to contact via e-mail: <a href="mailto:hannover.humanisten@web.de">hannover.humanisten@web.de</a></p>
  
  <h3>The Global Agora</h3>
  <p>Yes, we have changed name, again! (And url: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/global-agora/">https://www.meetup.com/global-agora/</a>). That’s because we are not just about Stoicism, and not just about New York. With regard to the first point, The Global Agora focuses on the Hellenistic take on philosophy as a way of life. While our major interest remains Stoicism, we also explore Epicureanism, Cynicism, and especially Skepticism. Concerning the second point, our events are now a mix of local (New York-based) and online (global). Recent events at The Global Agora include: a live podcast on the topic of “What does it mean to follow a philosophy of life?”; “7 lessons from Diogenes the Cynic”; an intensive online seminar on Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations; and an in-person intensive workshop on Seneca (held in Corsica, France).</p>
  
  <h3>Los Angeles Stoics</h3>
  <p>The L.A. Stoics continue to meet regularly on a weekly and monthly basis. We are an active community that strive to accommodate everyone regardless of your interest and level of experience. Check out our website for general information and to sign up for our email notifications: <a href="http://www.lastoics.com">http://www.lastoics.com</a> … Keep an eye out for Stoicon-X Los Angeles in November. If you’re interested in speaking at the conference, email the facilitator at <a href="mailto:justin@lastoics.com">justin@lastoics.com</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Nashville Stoics</h3>
  <p>The Nashville Stoics continue to meet twice a month to explore Stoic theory and practice at an East Nashville brewery. We have reached the state of having regular members whose continued input helps enhance the discussion with visitors and new members. Also, we created a Discord page for our local group. The app is handy for dissemination of information and for continuing the conversation after we meet. If someone has a burning question they can post it to the forum for members to engage with as they are able. If you are interested in joining, reach out to us on Meetup <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nashville-stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/nashville-stoics/</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:NashvilleStoics@gmail.com">NashvilleStoics@gmail.com</a>! </p>
  
  <h3>New England Stoics</h3>
  <p>The New England stoics just surpassed a thousand people on our Meetup page so we are growing. We continue to host weekly meditations as well as continue with our practice class. The philosophers Cafe which is our standard free meeting had a special event in which we hosted it on spectacle Island in Boston harbor. Spectacle island is part of the harbor Islands and is listed in the national Park service. It is 30 minute ferry ride and overlooks the Boston skyline with over 5 miles of trails. We hosted a meeting on this island and we even flew some kites. It was a very successful event.</p>
  
  <h3>New York City Stoics</h3>
  <p>The NYC Stoics are in the midst of our 2022 theme: Before Stoicism. We’re spending this year taking a look at what came before Stoicism and what influence its founder — Zeno of Citium — in founding the philosophy. So far, we’ve covered the pre-Socratics and have just completed reading five Platonic Dialogues. In August, we’ll be reading the same thing Zeno read which led him to start practicing philosophy when he was shipwrecked in Athens: Book II of Xenophon’s Memorabilia. These reading groups are online, so you can join even if you’re not in NYC!

  <h3>Orlando Stoics</h3>
  <p>Our group continues to grow and has meetings Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays. Some meetings are online, others in-person. We recently finished reviewing the book “The Practicing Stoic” by Ward Farnsworth, and now we are beginning a new series for the book “The Pocket Stoic” by John Sellars.

  <h3>San Antonio Stoics</h3>
  <p>The San Antonio Stoics started in February of this year and we meet every third Thursday of the month. Since then we’ve grown to six regular members. As a group we’re reading The Practicing Stoic by Ward Farnsworth and it’s led to some great discussions! If you’re in the area come check us out: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/452723076390876">https://www.facebook.com/groups/452723076390876</a> </p>
  
  <h3>Stoics of Daytona Beach</h3>
  <p>A small discussion group, which meets monthly and talks about Seneca’s essays. Now we are reviewing “On the shortness of life”. If you like Seneca, you’ll like this discussion with StoicDan’s introductions. Info - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/stoics/</a> </p>
  
  <h3>Tampa Stoics</h3>
  <p>This monthly group meets in-person near USF (one block away) in Tampa. Our monthly meeting is a discussion of The Discourses by Epictetus, and it’s hosted by Edin. If you like Epictetus, this is a great practice event too! Info - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/tampa-stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/tampa-stoics/</a> </p>
  
  <h3>The Philadelphia Stoa</h3>
  <p>In June we started monthly meetings to discuss the book, Breakfast with Seneca by David Fideler.  We continue to hold monthly meetings on A Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine.  We’re also continuing with monthly “Introduction to Stoicism” meetings intended mainly for newcomers.   Our weekly Stoic practice group continues to meet.  The current format is to have everyone check-in by describing any challenges they’ve experienced and how their Stoic practice is going.  We follow that with a discussion on a Stoic-related question, such as “What does it mean to love humankind?”.  </p>
  
  <h3>Trondheim Stoics</h3>
  <p>The Trondheim Stoics had a very enjoyable meeting with more guests than usual prior to the summer holidays. We explored Axel Honneth’s theory of recognition from a Stoic perspective, touching on virtue and circles of concern among other topics. July is relatively quiet, especially since most Norwegian’s take the last two/three weeks of July completely off. But we are prepared to start strong again in August! </p>
