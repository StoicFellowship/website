        <h2>Updates from Stoics Around the World</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Each quarter, Stoic leaders from around the world share updates from their local Stoicism communities.
        </p>

        <h3><u>January 2022</u></h3>

<div style="text-align: left;">    

<p>


  <h3>Copenhagen Stoa</h3>
  <p>
    Due to COVID we have been having online meetings for the last 1-1½ year. This has shown some positive sides compared to meeting face to face. One is that it’s easier to fit into people's schedules making attendance more regular, but also that we have had people from outside Copenhagen joining us. Lately from other places in Denmark as well and southern part of Sweden by people that have some sort of relationship to Denmark/Copenhagen. All in all, the group is back to have around 6-8 attendees. We are trying a new format, which is to pick a contemporary article/blog and pair it with a Stoic text. We then discuss the article/blog from a Stoic perspective thereby distancing ourselves and our own opinion from the topic of the article/blog. This has so far led to some great discussions with a new twist.

  </p>
  <h3>Fremont Stoa</h3>
  <p>
    Looking forward to the new year, platelet donations, calendar, month of service preparations and more.
    Intergalactic is Fremont’s all volunteer Stoic school with a Reading Program that begins in March. Sign up to read a foundational text in a group environment and pick up some Stoic fundamentals along the way: <a href="https://www.intergalactic.school/" target="_blank">Intergalatic School</a>  plus, help us test out the new 1.0 Stoic workbook. Enrollment is free, but limited.  2022 marks the program’s fourth year helping readers.
  </p>
  <h3>Hannover Stoics:</h3>
  <p>
    Looking back, we´ve had quite a year. Finally, after it had to be cancelled in 2020, we managed to facilitate Stoicon-X Hannover as an online meeting. With about 13 participants it was also the first of its kind in Germany. Apart from one live regulars table, we have switched completely to online meetings, and as it seems, in Stoic fashion, we´re going full cosmopolitan this year, since most of our participants live all over Germany, or even in the US. Looking forward, we will continue to facilitate a monthly Stoic Monday (next dates: February 7th, March 7th, 6 pm CET). In addition, we will be hosting a Stoic literature reading on each Wednesday at 7 pm CEST, starting on January 19th. The latter will be in cooperation with another group near Frankfurt, which is facilitated by Alexander Zock and Robert Colter. Hopefully we will also have a live regulars table again on April 1st. And lastly, we are looking forward to hosting Stoicon-X Hannover 2022. This year's topic will be Stoicism in schools, any help with suggestions to interesting speakers is appreciated.

  <h3>Kansas City Stoa</h3>
  <p>
    A trio met online for the first time to share their "coming to Stoicism" stories, started an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kcstoa/">Instagram</a> page with our Google Calendar link, and agreed to meet again a month later to discuss the short but meaningful <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html">Chapter 4</a> in Epictetus' handbook.

  </p>
  <h3>Los Angeles Stoics</h3>
  <p>
    The L.A. Stoics continue to meet twice a month—every second Saturday at 9am in-person (and sometimes online) and every third Tuesday at 6pm online. The Saturday morning meetings are currently centered around Epictetus' Discourses. The Tuesday evening meetings are currently centered around Lawrence Becker's A New Stoicism (Revised Ed.) Check out <a href="www.losangelesstoics.com">www.losangelesstoics.com</a> for meeting information. <a href="mailto: lastoics@gmail.com">Email Justin</a> if you have questions or would like to join the "Los Angeles Stoics" Discord server.
  </p>
  <h3>Monterey Stoics</h3>
  <p>
    Monterey Stoics: We continue into our third year of meeting in a hybrid fashion on Sunday mornings at 7:30 am. We have a core group of 10 members and have found that this is an intimate way of sharing thoughts and going deeper into the materials. We are currently working through The Enchiridion. To serve more beginning interests in Stoicism, we will begin another pod-group, using Massimo’s “Handbook for New Stoics” as the year-long curriculum. We continue monthly beach clean-ups while wearing “Monterey Stoics” on bright vests. Although we receive many smiles and thanks for keeping the beaches clean, our community service is a small part of doing what is needed- rather than for esteem. If you are interested in visiting, <a href="mailto:montereystoics@gmail.com">email us</a>.

  </p>
  <h3>Munich Stoics</h3>
  <p>
    Recently founded, it is the group and the community for discussing and exchanging ideas about Stoicism, Hellenistic philosophies, and philosophy as a way of life, in Munich (Germany) and surroundings. In English and German language. First in-person event on Saturday 22nd January 2022. Our community: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/munichstoics">https://www.facebook.com/groups/munichstoics</a>
  </p>
  <h3>Nashville Stoics</h3>
   <p>
    The Nashville Stoa continues to grow and adapt. Starting January of 2022 we have set up a separate, practice based group that will be working through A Handbook For New Stoics by Massimo Pigliucci and Greg Lopez. In addition to the monthly discussion meet-up (at East Nashville Beer Works) in which we cover a variety of topics, the new group will meet on its own to discuss progress and the experience of daily practice. If you’re in the area and would like to stop by and check us out or grab a good beer you can find more info at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nashville-stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/nashville-stoics/</a>
  </p>
  <h3>New England stoics</h3>
   <p>
    The group has been extremely active with more than seven events each month: each Thursday evening we have meditation sessions that are inspired by Stoic philosophy quotes; on different Sundays we have Stoic practice classes, a women’s group meeting, an open-discussion philosophers cafe, and a guided meditation session.  Our Stoic book club has just launched. To address pandemic needs we have a hybrid of in person/remote approach, with An increasing amount of activities  taking place on Discord  Check us out on: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/New-England-Stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/New-England-Stoics/</a>

  </p>
  <h3>New York City Stoics</h3>
   <p>
    The NYC Stoics have a theme each year to try to add some coherence to our learning. This year's theme is “Before Stoicism”, where we won't be covering Stoicism itself; instead, we’ll be discussing the Greek philosophies that influenced Stoicism, starting with the Presocratics and ranging through the Old Academy. We hold both online and in-person meetings. If you’re interested in joining a meeting, check out our schedule at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Stoics/</a>

  <h3>Orlando Stoics</h3>
   <p>
    The group has surpassed 1700 members and 750 events. We are still growing! Mondays we talk Stoic ideas, Fridays are Stoic practice, Saturdays are in-person meetings, and on Sundays, StoicDan presents new lectures. In addition, we had a mini-event 1-14-2022, when Donald Robertson visited for 1.5 hours and discussed his book “How to think like a Roman Emperor” plus future projects. We had about 90 RSVPs and 65 people showed up. It was a great conversation with a Modern Stoic! Video coming soon to Youtube in the StoicDan channel.

  </p>
  <h3>Oslo Stoics</h3>
   <p>
    We have had a few online meetings since the last IQ. The covid pandemic seemed to be on a little break for a while, but now it is quite difficult to meet in person. The meetings have usually been attended by 4-8 people, which has been normal for the last year or two. The topics and approaches have varied from meeting to meeting. Sometimes we have settled on a theme and tried to find sources from the Stoic texts that discusses the theme, and other times we have settled on a specific text and read through it in entirety prior to the meeting and then discussed it at the meeting. The last meeting was about Seneca's On the Happy Life. 
  </p>
  <h3>PDX Virtual Stoa</h3>
   <p>
    We're planning to read  “Philosophy as a Way of Life” by Pierre Hadot this year.  

  </p>
  <h3>Pretoria Stoics</h3>
   <p>
    We stopped meeting during the pandemic. We continued with a WhatsApp group in which we share material on Stoicism and have occasional discussions on material shared. We plan to resume our monthly meetings when the COVID situation allows for it.
  </p>
  <h3>Stoa Gallica</h3>
   <p>
The main news of the Stoa Gallica association in 2021 was the organization of the first French Stoicon-x. About a hundred people gathered at ESSEC Business School on Saturday October 16 for a day dedicated to the study and practice of contemporary stoicism. Conferences, round tables, workshops and free discussions punctuated the day, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. This day had two main objectives:
<ul class="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>Discover or deepen our knowledge of Stoic philosophy, and reflect on its relevance for us today.</li> 
  <li>Promote exchanges between the participants and strengthen this community of research and practice that already exists around Stoic philosophy and its current practice.</li>
</ul>
And these two objectives have largely been achieved. The richness of the presentations and the quality of the exchanges allowed not only novices to discover Stoic philosophy, but also people who were already interested in the Stoic way of life to deepen their knowledge and reflect on the best way to implement, right now, certain exercises, certain principles of the Stoic philosophy. This day was also and perhaps above all the occasion for new philosophical encounters. It was an important moment in the constitution and in the life of a French-speaking community of Stoic students and practitioners (see <a href="https://stoagallica.fr/une-journee-pour-decouvrir-et-pratiquer-le-stoicisme-contemporain-retour-sur-la-stoicon-x-paris-2021/">Une journée pour découvrir et pratiquer le stoïcisme contemporain: retour sur la Stoicon-x Paris 2021</a> for more details).
Our association also aims to become the showcase for the movement to update Stoicism in France and to provide a practical guide for anyone wishing to embrace this philosophy of life. The work of the association in the coming months will aim to finalize the creation of a training course, both on the theoretical and practical aspects, of Stoic philosophy.

  </p>
  <h3>The Redwood Stoa</h3>
   <p>
    The Redwood Stoa continues with its monthly-topic-based meetings, still online although we did have one in-person meeting back in October (socially-distanced, etc.), which was at least a nice change - and it was out among the redwoods themselves, at that!  January’s topic was “Rational by Nature”, a Stoic tenet that is (always a generator of debate.  Some minutes of that meeting will eventually be available at our old Wordpress site, <a href="https://redwoodstoa.wordpress.com">https://redwoodstoa.wordpress.com</a>.  If my math is correct, we are beginning our 9th year in 2022, nearly a decade.  
  </p>
  <h3>Trondheim Stoics</h3>
   <p>
    Primarily online due to the pandemic, but we are trying to keep monthly meetings going. Topics have been going between reading the classics from Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, but we are also going to look at incorporating a bit more from Cicero, Musonius and others as well as modern thinkers. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/trondheim-stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/trondheim-stoics/</a>
