<h3>Brisbane Stoics</h3>
<p>Our little group meets monthly with 20-plus members turning up each meet. We focus on a broad range of stoic topics, which we present in a lecture and discussion format. We are interested in the Stoic idea of fellowship and encourage our members to build supportive friendships with one another. For more information check out our site at <a href="http://www.brisbanestoics.com">www.brisbanestoics.com</a></p>

<h3>Copenhagen Stoa</h3>
<p>We are still meeting monthly using a virtual platform as we now consistently have members from various places in Denmark and the southern part of Sweden. We are still testing a new format where the topic is formulated as a question as it encourages more discussion and participation and gives us a chance to also practice the Socratic Method.	</p>

<h3>Stoicism Meetup Group - Milford, Michigan</h3>
<p>Going into our second year of meetups, we are brand new to the Stoic Fellowship Network and are looking forward to growing our chapter with the hopes of having a brick and mortar location very soon. </p>

<h3>Frankfurt Stoics</h3>
<p>After a long summer pause we are back with regular meetings starting October. We quit Meet-up as a platform and are looking forward to using the new Stoic Fellowship Network for our Stoa. </p>

<h3>Fremont Stoa</h3>
<p>Another fun and exciting year with stoiconX event to add a nice EOY bookend. About 80+ members in our meetup group with a core group of about 15. A great summer picnic with good food, music and fellowship. The most fun event we do is hiking (walk & talk) , and will  probably have done about 10 by year's end. Celebrated with Redwood Stoa their 10th anniversary and a milestone for us to look forward to in 2028 !</p>

<h3>Intergalactic</h3>
<p>Based in the Bay Area of California, our little school is completing its 5th year and we’re excited to share that we are very close to completing a workbook series dedicated to the fundamentals of the Stoic philosophy and citizenship/community building.  Hope you will check out our space in the Stoic Fellowship Network!</p>

<h3>Kansas City Stoa</h3>
<p>A triad of Stoics in the Midwest meet once every month or two to discuss, one at a time, Matt Van Atta's podcast episodes (<a href="https://immoderatestoic.com/good-fortune">https://immoderatestoic.com/good-fortune</a>).</p>

<h3>Los Angeles Stoics</h3>
<p>LA Stoicon-X 2023 will take place on Nov. 11 at 10:00 a.m. (find more updates at <a href="https://lastoics.com/stoicon/">https://lastoics.com/stoicon/</a>). Besides this special event, our Stoa meets several times a month: weekly online meetings on Seneca’s Letters, monthly online meeting currently reading David Fideler’s Breakfast with Seneca, and a monthly in-person meeting where we casually discuss a topic of our choice. Check out our website for more info and a link to join our active Discord community: <a href="https://www.lastoics.com">https://www.lastoics.com</a> </p>

<h3>Monterey Stoics</h3>
<p>We continue to meet with 10 core members every Sunday morning from 7:30-8:30 am downtown Monterey, California at AMP (Access Monterey Peninsula). We are celebrating our 5th year. We begin with meeting norms, a review of our Stoic practice opportunities of the previous week and then read and discuss our chosen classic text. Currently, we are working through Seneca’s Letters. Eight members meet in person with 2-3 members who zoom in on line. Contact: <a href="mailto:montereystoics@gmail.com">montereystoics@gmail.com</a></p>

<h3>Munich Stoics</h3>
<p>The Munich Stoics keep meeting every 2 Saturdays in a cafè in central Munich, to discuss Stoicism as a philosophy of life. Our Stoa is lively and active, with regular meetings since its foundation, in January 2022. 
Discussions are open, and every participant is free to propose a  topic. We discuss Stoicism as a way of life, daily practice, the role of free will, how to master emotions, the role of reason and its bound with the Logos of the Universe. 
Meetings are organized via MeetUp platform. Join us at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/munichstoics/">www.facebook.com/groups/munichstoics/</a></p>

<h3>Nashville Stoics</h3>
<p>We continue to meet twice a month at East Nashville Beer Works to discuss theory and work through our book club reading. Our group is diverse and interesting with a variety of life experiences brought to each discussion. If you’re in Nashville, TN and looking for good company and an interesting discussion on Stoicism, check us out at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Nashville-stoics">www.meetup.com/Nashville-stoics</a> </p>

<h3>New York City Stoics</h3>
<p>We’re finishing up our year studying alternatives to Stoicism by covering practical Pyrrhonian Skepticism in a bit more detail. Our meetings are online so you’re welcome to join! For more info and to RSVP, go to: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Stoics/</a></p>

<h3>Orlando Stoics</h3>
<p>Our group continues to grow, with 4 meetings every week, and we’ve reached 2630+ members and 1100+ events to-date. StoicDan is the organizer and works every week to build the community by picking interesting topics in and around Stoicism, plus inviting fascinating guests. Recently, Massimo Pigliucci from NYC visited the group on a Monday night and discussed virtues from the Stoic tradition. To learn about the meetings on Monday and Friday nights, plus Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings, visit the official web site: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/orlando-stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/orlando-stoics/</a>  </p>

<h3>Pretoria Stoics</h3>
<p>We currently have 15 loosely affiliated members and continue to keep contact via WhatsApp. </p>

<h3>Redwood Stoa</h3>
<p>Celebrating our 10th year as a continuously-meeting monthly stoa, we recently had two in-person meetings - one in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, and one in the Regional Botanic Garden in the hills above Berkeley.   At the garden, we were able to sit in the shade of a small redwood reserve to have our discussion.  Thanks to everyone who came; our next meeting (November) will be on line.    </p>

<h3>Rheinland Stoiker</h3>
<p>2023 ist our year of the virtues. Our group continues growing. We started meeting online on a regular basis every other Thursday and discussing the virtues in depth and “in reverse”. That means we’re reverse-engineering the meaning of the virtues based on the text of the ancient Stoics and modern academics - thus avoiding to apply our own meaning to what each virtue means.
Everybody can join our meetings, which are held in german language and don’t need any specific level of knowledge.

<h3>Stoa Gallica</h3>
<p>Our French-speaking group continues to grow (80+ members). We're holding our third Stoicon-x in Paris on November 25 at the Université Paris Dauphine (<a href="https://www.billetweb.fr/stoicon-x-paris-2023">https://www.billetweb.fr/stoicon-x-paris-2023</a>). We have also translated the Stoic Week booklet into French to enable our members who are less at ease with English to participate in Stoic Week (6-12 November).  Every month, we organize face-to-face Stoic meetings for around 80 people in Lausanne (Switzerland), as well as virtual meetings for our members, who are scattered throughout the French-speaking world (mainly France, Switzerland, Belgium and Canada). Find out more about our events and activities on our website: <a href="https://stoagallica.fr/">https://stoagallica.fr/</a> </p>

<h3>Stoa Helvetica</h3>
<p>Stoa Helvetica has been in existence for just over a year and currently has three (!) members. I am sure that we will find many new members in the coming months and years.  </p>

<h3>Stoics of Daytona Beach</h3>
<p>This is a small group, but some of the members will be attending Stoicon this fall year.</p>

<h3>Stoics of Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>The Washington Stoics have been continuing to have casual meetings at a local bar & grill roughly once a month.  Lately we have been working through the Meditations, choosing a few books at a time to designate for discussions.  We have primarily been using Facebook to organize events (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/254649714042657/">https://www.facebook.com/events/254649714042657/</a>), but we also use an email list to try and include members who aren’t on Facebook (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/stoics-of-washington-dc/about">https://groups.google.com/g/stoics-of-washington-dc/about</a>).</p>

<h3>Tampa Stoics</h3>
<p>An active group with 2 meetings a month (one discussion, one walking meditation). Edin is the organizer and writes the outlines each month. The group is currently reviewing the book “Stoicism and Emotion” by Margaret Graver. The group is open to the public; anyone can attend and build their Stoic practice. Note: they have changed venues recently to accommodate more people, so please visit the meetup site for the new address: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Stoics/">https://www.meetup.com/Tampa-Stoics/</a> </p>

<h3>Manchester Stoics</h3>
<p>Continue to meet monthly online via Google Meet, details can be found via our Facebook group here: <a href="https://m.facebook.com/groups/398232340356000/">https://m.facebook.com/groups/398232340356000/</a> or by contacting me directly at <a href="mailto:brendaklanigan@gmail.com">brendaklanigan@gmail.com</a></p>

<h3>The Practicing Stoic</h3>
<p>We continue our close reading of The Enchiridion of Epictetus  with in-person, twice monthly gatherings. A typical meeting will consist of 5 to 7 people, a few of whom will be new to the subject. We have particularly enjoyed the discussions and camaraderie of the group. It is low-key and inviting, yet not without flourishes into wide ranging topics.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Stoics</h3>
<p>We meet on the last Saturday of the month and are now in our fifth year. We have over 500 members, and limit the in-person events to 25 people at the request of the host venue. Meetings are in English, and we have participants from all over the world. Last year, we loosely based meetings on David Fideler’s Breakfast With Seneca, focussing on a different chapter each month. Using this book to set the theme, each meeting was based around several longish excerpts of Seneca. Having stuck with this for a full year, we recently moved on to Pierre Hadot’s The Inner Citadel, preparing worksheets with excerpts from the Meditations in a similar way. We’re planning to start a Japanese-language meeting too, with the first meeting set for November.  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Stoicism-Meetup-Group/">https://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Stoicism-Meetup-Group/</a></p>
