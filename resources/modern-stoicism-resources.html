    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56769533-breakfast-with-seneca" target="_blank">Breakfast with Seneca: A Stoic Guide to the Art of Living</a> by David Fideler. The book mines Seneca’s classic works in a series of focused chapters, clearly explaining Seneca’s ideas without oversimplifying them. Best enjoyed as a daily ritual, like an energizing cup of coffee, Seneca’s wisdom provides us with a steady stream of time-tested advice about the human condition—which, as it turns out, hasn’t changed much over the past two thousand years.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5617966-a-guide-to-the-good-life" target="_blank">A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</a> by William Irvine.

    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31423245-how-to-be-a-stoic" target="_blank">How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life</a> by Massimo Pigliucci. A personal introduction to Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40591934-a-handbook-for-new-stoics" target="_blank">A Handbook for New Stoics: How to Thrive in a World Out of Your Control—52 Week-by-Week Lessons</a> by Massimo Pigliucci and Gregory Lopez. Stress often comes from situations that are beyond our control—such as preparing for a meeting, waiting for test results, or arguing with a loved one. But we can control our response to these everyday tensions—through the wisdom and practice of Stoicism. Stoicism is an ancient pragmatic philosophy that teaches us to step back, gain perspective, and act with intention.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863499-how-to-think-like-a-roman-emperor" target="_blank">How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius</a> by Donald Robertson.

    <p><strong>Advanced Resources</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/865824.The_Morality_of_Happiness" target="_blank">The Morality of Happiness</a> by Julia Annas. Ancient ethical theories, based on the notions of virtue and happiness, have struck many as an attractive alternative to modern theories. But we cannot find out whether this is true until we understand ancient ethics--and to do this we need to examine the basic structure of ancient ethical theory, not just the details of one or two theories.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1734622.A_New_Stoicism" target="_blank">A New Stoicism</a> by Lawrence C. Becker. What would stoic ethics be like today if stoicism had survived as a systematic approach to ethical theory, if it had coped successfully with the challenges of modern philosophy and experimental science?</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7179532-the-structured-self-in-hellenistic-and-roman-thought" target="_blank">The Structured Self in Hellenistic and Roman Thought</a> by Christopher Gill. A new analysis of what is innovative in Hellenistic - especially Stoic and Epicurean - philosophical thinking about selfhood and personality.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1734623.Stoicism_and_Emotion" target="_blank">Stoicism and Emotion</a> by Margaret Graver. On the surface, stoicism and emotion seem like contradictory terms. Yet the Stoic philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome were deeply interested in the emotions, which they understood as complex judgments about what we regard as valuable in our surroundings.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/330370.The_Inner_Citadel" target="_blank">The Inner Citadel: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</a> by Pierre Hadot. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are treasured today - as they have been over the centuries - as an inexhaustible source of wisdom. And as one of the three most important expressions of Stoicism, this is an essential text for everyone interested in ancient religion and philosophy. Yet the clarity and ease of the work's style are deceptive. Pierre Hadot, eminent historian of ancient thought, uncovers new levels of meaning and expands our understanding of its underlying philosophy.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1203531.The_Cambridge_Companion_to_the_Stoics" target="_blank">Cambridge Companion to the Stoics edited</a> by Brad Inwood. The volume offers an odyssey through the ideas of the Stoics in three ways: through the historical trajectory of the school itself and its influence; the recovery of the history of Stoic thought; and finally, the ongoing confrontation with Stoicism.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18290251-the-role-ethics-of-epictetus" target="_blank">The Role Ethics of Epictetus: Stoicism in Ordinary Life</a> by Brian Johnson. The book offers an original interpretation of Epictetus's ethics and how he bases his ethics on an appeal to our roles in life. Epictetus believes that every individual is the bearer of many roles from sibling to citizen and that individuals are morally good if they fulfill the obligations associated with these roles.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1888218.Epictetus" target="_blank">Epictetus: A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life</a> by A.A. Long. The philosophy of Epictetus, a freed slave in the Roman Empire, has been profoundly influential on Western thought: it offers not only stimulating ideas but practical guidance in living one's life. A. A. Long, a leading scholar of later ancient philosophy, gives the definitive presentation of the thought of Epictetus for a broad readership.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/661677.The_Roman_Stoics" target="_blank">The Roman Stoics: Self, Responsibility, and Affection</a> by Gretchen Reydams-Schils. The book reexamines the philosophical basis that instructed social practice in friendship, marriage, parenting, and community life. From this analysis, Stoics emerge as neither cold nor detached, as the stereotype has it, but all too aware of their human weaknesses.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126418-the-art-of-living" target="_blank">The Art of Living: The Stoics on the Nature and Function of Philosophy</a> by John Sellars. The book considers the Socratic background to Stoic thinking about philosophy and Skeptical objections raised by Sextus Empiricus, and offers readings of late Stoic texts by Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1359572.Stoicism" target="_blank">Stoicism</a> By John Sellars. This book is a great introduction into many Stoic philosophers and their ideas. It is easily accessible for the average reader and provides good historical context. It covers the three main branches of Stoic theories and explores many other popular Stoic ideas such as the Dichotomy of control.</p>
